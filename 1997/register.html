<p align="left">Dear Potential Symposium Registrant,</p>

<p align="left">You are invited to register for the 1997
Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics. We hope this symposium will
stimulate research in interactive 3D graphics by bringing
together many of the outstanding researchers from academia,
industry, and government. </p>

<p align="left">The symposium will start with a reception on
Sunday evening, the 27th of April. We are planning full days of
talks on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (28th-30th of April) and
an evening banquet on Tuesday, the<br>
29th of April. </p>

<p align="left">To encourage better sharing of ideas the
symposium attendance will again be limited to 250 participants.
Please register promptly using the registration form at the end
of this message. </p>

<p align="left">We have a limited number of 
<a href="student.htm"><b>student scholarships</b></a>
