<p ALIGN="left"><font size="3">The symposium will focus on the frontiers of

real-time interactive 3D computer graphics and multimedia. The symposium will consist of formal paper sessions and

hands-on demonstrations where research groups and vendors will show the

state-of-the-art in the field. Topics of interest for technical sessions and

demonstrations include:</font></p>

<ul>

  <li><font size="3">interaction techniques for 3D systems, including

    domain-specific interaction methods.</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">innovative human-machine interface paradigms for

    navigating, working, and playing in complex, real-time graphics

    environments, including virtual worlds, Web-based systems, and visualization

    systems;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">high-performance 3D graphics architectures, hardware, and

    software for interacting with virtual worlds and teleoperation systems;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">recent developments in small and inexpensive devices for

    input or output, including game devices.</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">novel actuator devices for controlling virtual or physical

    systems through forces, gestures, or speech;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">novel sensory output devices for seeing, hearing, and

    feeling in the virtual world;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">perceptual and psychological issues in multimodal

    interaction and operation in complex virtual spaces;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">interactive model-building tools for shaping, building, or

    sculpting of objects, and the interactive assembly and manipulation of

    systems of parts;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">languages, APIs, or tools for specifying geometry and

    behaviors for interactive and network-based applications;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">algorithms for animating complex reactive characters; tools

    for constructing reactive models;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">interactive simulations distributed over local and

    wide-area networks;</font></li>

  <li><font size="3">systems for representing, designing, visualizing, and

    interacting with complex geometry, structure, and behavior.</font></li>

<p>Paper submission deadline:&nbsp; 5 PM, EDT, SEPTEMBER 15, 2000</p>

<p><a name="Paper Submission Guidelines">Paper Submission Guidelines</a></p>

</font></b>

<p>Paper submission deadline is 5 PM, EDT, SEPTEMBER 15, 2000.</p>

<p>Only electronic, full-length paper submissions will be processed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I3D 2001 will accept for publication only papers reporting work which has not

been previously published in a conference proceedings or journal. Authors may

submit papers based on work that has been shown elsewhere, but which has not

described in a publication. Specifically, work previously shown in a poster

session or as a SIGGRAPH annual conference sketch may be submitted. Authors may

submit papers on work that has been publicly distributed only as a preprint or

tech report.<br>

<br>

<b>Paper Formats</p>

</b>

<p>We will accept two types of papers:</p>

<p>1.) &quot;Long papers&quot; -- up to 12 pages in length, including figures.

This is the format for reporting mature research results or to describe robust

working systems. Performance claims should be supported by actual measurements.

Full explanations of any special techniques necessary to achieve real-time

picture generation and display should be provided. The paper should clearly

state what has been achieved and how this makes a contribution to the

state-of-the-art in interactive 3D graphics.</p>

<p>2.) &quot;Short papers&quot; -- up to 4 pages in length, including figures.

This is the format for interesting work &quot;in progress,&quot; where

preliminary results are available but a careful evaluation has not been done

yet, or for break-through speculative proposals that have not yet been reduced

to practice. In both cases enough results or analysis should be made available

to demonstrate that the described prototypes or concepts have merit and are of

use.</p>

<p>Both types of submitted papers should be in close-to-final form with respect

to content -- they'll be evaluated on what they describe, not on what COULD be

done. Refinements, enhancements and improved figures can be added later after

the completion of the formal review process.</p>

<b>

<p>Video Tapes</p>

</b>

<p>Videotapes of work reported in a paper submission are strongly recommended,

where appropriate. Seven (7) copies of any accompanying video must be received

by the same deadline, 5 PM EDT, September 15, 2000. All video tapes must be NTSC

VHS format.</p>

<p>Submit videos to:</p>

<b>

<p>Reviewing</p>

</b>

<p>The program committee will review all papers submitted by the deadline in a

double-anonymous reviewing process. Authors will be notified of the results of

the review around November 6th.</p>

<p>The authors of a long paper may be asked to rewrite their paper as a short

paper (but not the other way round). Long papers will be given 25 minutes of

presentation time at the symposium; short papers will get 15 minutes of

presentation time.</p>

<b>

<p>Publication</p>

</b>

<p>Authors of accepted papers commit themselves to submitting a camera-ready

final manuscript by December 8 and video by January 7.&nbsp; Guidelines for authors of
accepted papers can be found <a href="ai-small-conferences1.pdf">here</a>. The
required copyright form can be found <a href="acm-copyright-form.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the event that either of the manuscript or the video has not been

submitted by the deadline, the committee reserves the right to remove the paper

from the symposium, or use the original paper and/or video in the symposium

proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
