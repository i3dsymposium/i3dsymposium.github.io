									</font>
									<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Paper Submissions</font></h3>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Paper submission deadline was </font><font color="#ee0000" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">5 PM, PST, October 25, 2002</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Only electronic, full-length paper submissions in pdf format will be processed. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#ee0000" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The web site for paper submission was <a href="SubmissionSystem.html">here</a>:</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I3D 2003 will accept for publication only papers reporting work which has not been previously published in a conference proceedings or journal. Authors may submit papers based on work that has been shown elsewhere, but which has not described in a publication. Specifically, work previously shown in a poster session or as a SIGGRAPH annual conference sketch may be submitted. Authors may submit papers on work that has been publicly distributed only as a preprint or tech report.</font></p>
									<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Paper Formats</font></h3>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will accept two types of papers:</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">1.) &#147;Long papers&#148; -- up to 12 pages in length, including figures. This is the format for reporting mature research results or to describe robust working systems. Performance claims should be supported by actual measurements. Full explanations of any special techniques necessary to achieve real-time picture generation and display should be provided. The paper should clearly state what has been achieved and how this makes a contribution to the state-of-the-art in interactive 3D graphics.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">2.) &#147;Short papers&#148; -- up to 4 pages in length, including figures. This is the format for interesting work &quot;in progress,&quot; where preliminary results are available but a careful evaluation has not been done yet, or for break-through speculative proposals that have not yet been reduced to practice. In both cases enough results or analysis should be made available to demonstrate that the described prototypes or concepts have merit and are of use.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Both types of submitted papers should be in close-to-final form with respect to content -- they'll be evaluated on what they describe, not on what COULD be done. Refinements, enhancements and improved figures can be added later after the completion of the formal review process.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Papers should be submitted in camera-ready format. Formatting instructions can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031014162651/http://www.siggraph.org/publications/prep/">here</a>. </font></p>
									<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Panels</font></h3>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Panel submissions should follow the Short Paper format and include no more than five total panel members, including the panel chair. Panel submissions follow the same submission procedure as for submitted papers.</font></p>
									<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Video Tapes and DVDs</font></h3>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The <a href="SubmissionSystem.html">submission system</a> is set up to accept Quicktime and MPEG video that accompanies submitted papers or video that stands on its own for symposium DVD consideration. Video clips submitted through the submission system are for play across the web for review purposes. Accepted video for the symposium DVD will be submitted as described below. If you must ship physical DVDs or videotapes for review, seven (7) copies of any accompanying video/DVD must be received by the same deadline, </font><font color="#ee0000" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">5PM PST, October 25, 2002</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">. All videotapes must be NTSC VHS format. DVDs must also be NTSC. Submit videos/DVDs to:</font></p>

									<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Reviewing</font></h3>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The program committee will review all papers submitted by the deadline. Authors will be notified of the results of the review around December 20th.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The authors of a long paper may be asked to rewrite their paper as a short paper (but not the other way round).

									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Authors of accepted papers may have one color plate page in addition to their paper, if they choose.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In the event that either of the manuscript or the video has not been submitted by the deadline, the committee reserves the right to remove the paper from the symposium, or use the original paper and/or video in the symposium proceedings. </font></p>
