<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will describe my research in computational
fluid dynamics targeted to the entertainment industry such as film and games. I
will cover the history of Fluid Dynamics and how these equations are solved in
practice on a computer. The emphasis is on simple, stable and rapid solutions
which yield visually realistic flows. The solver has been used in our MAYA
Autodesk animation software and has received a Technical Achievement Award from
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2007. We will also mention
an iOS App called FluidFX and a OSX App called MotionFX. Both apps are based on
the same technology. The talk will be accompanied by many live demonstrations
and movies.</p>

<p><b>Bio:</b> Jos Stam was born in the Netherlands and educated in Geneva,
Switzerland, where he received dual Bachelor degrees in computer science and
pure mathematics. In 1989, Stam moved to Toronto where he completed his Masters
and Ph.D. degrees in computer science. After that he pursued postdoctoral
studies as a ERCIM fellow at INRIA in France and at VTT in Finland. In 1997
Stam joined the Alias Seattle office as a researcher and stayed there until
2003 to relocate to Alias' main office in Toronto. Stam is now employed with
Autodesk as a Senior Research Scientist as part of Autodesk's acquisition of
Alias in 2006.</p>

<p>Stam's research spans several areas of computer graphics: natural phenomena,
physics-based simulation, rendering and surface modeling, especially
subdivision surfaces. His latest creation is a unified dynamics solver called
Nucleus, which is embedded in MAYA and has been used in many movies to create
special effects. He has published papers in all of these areas in journals and
at conferences, most notably at the annual SIGGRAPH conference. In 2005 Stam
was awarded one of the most prestigeous awards in computer graphics: the
SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award. Stam also won two Technical
Achievement Awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: in
2005 for his work on subdivision surfaces and in 2007 for his work on fluid
dynamics. He was also featured in a January 2008 Wired magazine article.</p>

    <p><b>Title:</b> Briding the gap: Making research more practical</p>
</div>
<div class="grid_3 omega">
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In my former life as an academic, I attended many industry
panels at I3D, HPG, and occasionally at other conferences whose aim was to
improve cooperation between academics and industry.  My take-home lessons
amounted to “we need to keep talking about this,” “you’re not doing it right,”
and “why don’t you use real scenes?”  I never really found these discussions
truly illuminating.  Over the past few years as I transitioned into industry, I
gained some more specific insights into making academic research more
practical.  I’ll share some specific examples from my work, NVIDIA more
broadly, and success cases I’ve seen elsewhere that I hope may help other
academics looking to bridge the gap between research and production.</p>

<p><b>Bio:</b> Chris Wyman is a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA’s newly
formed real-time rendering research group in Redmond, WA.  Prior to moving to
Washington, he spent time as a visiting researcher at NVIDIA in Salt Lake City
and was an Associate Professor at the University of Iowa for nearly 10 years.
His PhD is from the University of Utah.  In prior years, he helped organize I3D
in various roles:  as Conference, Papers, and Posters chairs.  He has also
served on the SIGGRAPH organizing committee, and in 2013 chaired the SIGGRAPH
General Submissions jury.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will describe our research progress in
realistic rendering from the two end of the spectrum of rendering technologies:
real-time rendering for interactive applications and movie-quality rendering
for feature film production. For real-time rendering, the basic idea is to
restrict how the scene can be changed at run time and do some precomputation in
the restricted space to accelerate the runtime computation. We show how to
apply this idea to achieve interactive rendering of soft shadows, dynamic
BRDFs, smokes, and hairs on the GPU. For movie-quality rendering, we
demonstrate with our RenderAnts system that it is possible to remap the
REYES-based film rendering pipeline onto GPGPU platforms and achieve
significant speedups. We further extend the system to effectively support ray
tracing effects with carefully designed GPU spatial hierarchies. The system has
been deployed in two animation studios and is being used to render a 3D feature
film entitled "Blinky Bill".</p>

<p><b>Bio:</b> Kun Zhou is a Cheung Kong Professor and the Director of the
State Key Laboratory of CAD&amp;CG at Zhejiang University. Earlier, he was a
Lead Researcher of the Internet Graphics Group at Microsoft Research Asia. He
received his BS and PhD degrees from Zhejiang University in 1997 and 2002,
respectively. His research interests include geometry processing,
photorealistic rendering, computer animation and GPU parallel computing. He has
published more than 30 ACM SIGGRAPH/TOG papers and held over 20 patents in
these areas.</p>
