<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Creating transitions between images of different objects is a classical problem
in computer graphics.  The main challenge is to establish a map that aligns
corresponding image elements.  In this talk I?ll present techniques to help
automate this often tedious task.  The main idea is to optimize the alignment
of structurally compatible image neighborhoods.  We formulate this optimization
over a halfway parametric domain so that regions can either grow or shrink
without introducing mapping discontinuities.  The halfway domain also enables
direct evaluation of the morph in a pixel shader without mesh rasterization.
The algorithm is parallelized on a GPU to achieve a responsive interface.
Finally, I?ll show several extensions of the method, including the creation of
morphs between videos -- all with little user effort.

    <p class="lead">Natalya Tatarchuk</p>
    <p>Graphics Engineering Architect, Bungie</p>
    <p><b>Title:</b>Applied graphics research for video games: solving real-world problems under real-world constraints (Lessons from Destiny's development)</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
In video games of today, real-time graphics are often a crucial aspect of
engaging the player. Detailed and beautifully rendered worlds help create
immersive environments for the player to participate in. As the game developers
continue to improve the real-time rendering techniques, extracting the most out
of the current set of console capabilities, to give the players the best
experience possible, video game developers benefit by leaning strongly on
applied graphics research to help this process. This talk will cover the
practical considerations faced by video game developers, with respect to
hardware constraints, production considerations, including budget, resource and
time constraints.
</p>

<p>
In this talk, we will focus on how graphics research can be applied to the
real-world constraints of video games, drawing on the lessons of solving
real-world problems under real-world constraints and analyzing patterns learned
throughout Destiny's development. We will cover several examples of Destiny's
applied research and their integration into the shipping games engine. We will
discuss examples of techniques that were successfully integrated into the
shipping game, as well as analyze additional originally promising methods that
ultimately failed to work under the conditions of real hardware constraints or
the content creation needs of a shipping title. We will cover in depth what it
means to ship a cross-platform, scalable rendering engine with today's
rendering expectations, and the corresponding important considerations for
applied real-time research. Real-world hardware constraints with respect to
graphics techniques will be analyzed. We will discuss the content creation
implications that are important for graphics algorithms as well as current
trends for game worlds creation. Lastly, we will discuss some of the remaining
challenges faced by the game developers going forward in hopes of spurring more
applied research for that domain.

<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Physical simulations have a long history in engineering and have been
successfully used to complement real world experiments. Computer simulations
are used to study extreme conditions and very small time intervals. As a
consequence, the accuracy of the models used and their results are central to
engineering applications. For more than three decades, physical simulations
have also been used in computer graphics in order to increase the realism of
animations and to free artists from animating secondary motion by hand. Here,
accuracy is only important to the extent that plausible behavior is generated.
There are, however, additional requirements not present in engineering such as
controllability: movie directors and game developers want to be able to control
the collapse of a building or the path taken by a flood wave. Another aspect
that is central to games is stability. In the film industry, if a simulation
becomes unstable or does not yield the desired result, the artist simply
re-runs the shot. This is not possible in games because the way in which the
player will interact with a scene is not known in advance. In my talk I will
present a variety of simulation methods we have developed that are stable
enough for games, while still producing plausible physical behavior. Examples
are approaches to simulate soft bodies, clothing, destruction, liquids and a
unified solver combining all these effects.
</p>

<p><b>Bio:</b> 
Matthias Müller is Research Lead of the PhysX SDK team at NVIDIA. PhysX is a
GPU accelerated physically based simulation engine for computer games. His
research interests include the development of methods for the simulation of
rigid bodies, fracture, soft bodies, cloth and fluids that are fast,
controllable and robust enough to be used in game environments. He is a pioneer
in the field of position based dynamics and has been contributing to this and
other fields via numerous publications in the major computer graphics
conferences and journals. Position based dynamics has become the standard for
the simulation of soft bodies and cloth in computer games and has been adopted
by the film industry as well.
</p>
<p>
Matthias Müller received his Ph.D. from ETH Zurich for his work on the
atomistic simulation of dense polymer systems. During a two year post-doc with
the computer graphics group at MIT he changed his research focus from atomistic
offline simulations to macroscopic real time simulation in computer graphics.
In 2002 he co-founded Novodex, a company that developed a simulation engine for
computer games. In 2004 Novodex was acquired by AGEIA which, in turn, was
acquired by NVIDIA in 2008.
