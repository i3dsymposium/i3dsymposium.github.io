<p class="lead" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">I3D is the leading conference for real time 3D computer graphics and human interaction.</p><br>

<!--
<p><font color="#ffff00"><u><b>New!</b></u></font> Shuttles to DigiPen from the Hyatt House will be available in the morning and returning after the conference.  The shuttle is small (only seats 11), so please <u>stop by the Hyatt House front desk</u> to schedule your morning ride.  They will run between 8 and 9 am, with frequency depending on how many people sign up.  It's also a fairly easy 20-30 minute walk to campus (<a href="img/walkingToDigiPen.png">see our 'high-tech' walking map</a>).
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFF44"><b>New!</b></font> NVIDIA has donated a GeForce Titan X that will be presented to the winner of the (audience selected) best paper presentation, which is open to all papers (including JCGT and TVCG papers) presented at I3D.
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFF44"><b>New!</b></font> To clarify: all conference activities (including registration and meals) will be on the DigiPen campus.  For those staying at the Hyatt House, they also offer complementary breakfast.  (So you can eat twice!)
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFF4"><b>New!</b></font> Full details on Hao Chen's <a href="keynotes.html">Saturday keynote</a> are available.
