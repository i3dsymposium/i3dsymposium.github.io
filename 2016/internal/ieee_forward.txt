This special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) includes four extended papers from the 2016 ACM Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games. This edition marked the 20th conference since the inauguration in 1986.

The main focus of I3D is on disseminating novel techniques in computer graphics and human interaction with an emphasis on practical applications such as digital games. The proposed solutions cover a wide range of areas within the field, including rendering, animation, imaging, simulation, and interaction. Many of these techniques find practical uses in many fields, particularly in the game industry. 

I3D 2016 took place in Redmond, Washington, from February 27 to 28.
The conference took place in DigiPen Institute of Technology which helped connect with researchers and practioners working on state of art techniques in graphics, HCI, and gaming. 

The conference received a total of 48 paper submissions of which 20 were accepted via a rigorous peer review process by a papers committee comprised of 49 experts from academia and industry. The papers that received the highest review scores were referred for a TVCG extended version. These papers, which are presented in this issue, underwent the full TVCG review process.

The extended papers include novel interactive techniques for lighting, radiosity, transparency, and crowd simulation.
Area lighting has been a major challenge for real-time rendering. In "Accurate Analytic Approximations for Real-Time Specular Area Lighting" which won the best paper and presentation awards, the authors address this challenge by analytical formulation of integral for polygonal light sources with specular reflectors.
"Sequential Monte Carlo Instant Radiosity" proposes the first interactive global illumination algorithm that works in complex, highly-occluded environments by placing and maintaining virtual point light sources via a novel heuristic sampling method.
In "Path Patterns: Analyzing and Comparing Real and Simulated Crowds", the authors propose a new approach based on machine learning to find latent path patterns in both real and simulated crowd data for analysis and comparison.
Translucent objects are pervasive in cinematic environments but are difficult to simulate in real-time.
"A Phenomenological Scattering Model for Order-Independent Transparency" introduces the first real-time rasterization algorithm that can simultaneously approximate a variety of transparency phenomena, including wavelength-varying transmission, translucent colored shadows, caustics, partial coverage, diffusion, and refraction.

In addition to the papers program, I3D 2016 also included a posters and demos session, games industry panel, and a keynote by Hao Chen. We are extremely grateful to the IPC as well as everyone involved in the organization of all the programs, which made it a successful conference with many high quality works. Finally, we thank TVCG for continuing to provide this opportunity, which provides further exposure some of the top innovations from I3D.
