<h4>Abstract</h4> 
<p align="justify">
Games are one of the primary users of real-time 3D graphics, but there is an oft-noted gap between published research and game development needs. This talk will look at how the differing goals, motivations, and economics of academia and the games industry drive academic research and game development in different directions. It will also explore the area of overlap, how to build stronger ties between them, and when to let them go, all backed up by personal examples and experience.

<h4>Bio</h4> 
<p align="justify">
Marc Olano has been doing research on uses of graphics hardware for real-time 3D graphics and non-graphics applications for over 25 years. He is currently is an Associate Professor in the CSEE department at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, director of UMBC's game development track and the new 3D photogrammetric scanning facility, and is on the advisory boards for the 324-node high performance computing facility and PI2 Cave-style VR facility. He is also Editor in Chief of the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques, an open-access journal dedicated to practical graphics research.</p>

<p>Dr. Olano received his PhD from the University of North Carolina for the first high-level shading language for graphics hardware, now one of the defining features of all graphics accelerators. After his PhD, he worked at Silicon Graphics on some of the earliest commercial efforts to develop programmable graphics hardware. Since coming to UMBC, his work has focused on applications of this now ubiquitous hardware for computation, visualization and, of course, games. In support of the games aspects of that research focus, he spent a year at Firaxis games working on Civilization V, is in the middle of a year at Epic Games working with the Unreal Engine 4 rendering team, and has also worked with Activision, 2K, and Oxide Games.</p>
