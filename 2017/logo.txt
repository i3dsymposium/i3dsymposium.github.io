For the logo, there is an img/logo.xcf file which is the layered
logo in the GIMP file format. The text is on two separate editable
layers. For the drop shadow:

NEW METHOD
 - Duplicate the previous year's text layer
 - From the Filters menu, select Light and Shadow >> Drop Shadow...
 - In the Drop Shadow dialog, 
      Set Offset X and Offset Y to 4 and Blur Radius to 15 [the defaults]
      Set Opacity to 70%. 
      Make sure "allow resizing" is checked.

PREVIOUS METHOD
  - Duplicate the text layer
  - Offset the layer by 5px in the x and 4px in the y
  - Fill the text with rgb(51, 51, 51) using the bucket
  - Apply a gaussian blur filter with a 10px radius
  - Set the layer opacity to 70%
  - The layer boundary size may need to be adjusted to not clip
