    <p><b>What to submit?</b><br>
    Poster and demo submissions should consist of a one-page extended abstract
    in PDF format. The abstract must follow the ACM SIGGRAPH formatting
    guidelines for poster abstracts (linked below). Copyright space is not
    necessary. All extended abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital
    Library (DL). Note that this still allows you to submit your work as a full
    paper to another conference or journal.</p>

    <p><b>How to submit?</b><br>
    Please e-mail your submission to
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
    var Foo = "i3dsymposium.org";
    var Bar = "mail" + "to:" + "posters@" + Foo;
    document.write("<a href=\"" + Bar + "\"" + ">");
    document.write("posters@" + Foo);
    document.write("<\/a>");
    </script>
    </p>
    <p>
    Include a one page abstract; other supplementary material (under 25MB)
    may optionally be attached to your e-mail.  If your supplementary material 
    will be larger than 25 MB, please check with the Posters Chair to discuss
    possible arrangements <i>prior</i> to the submission deadline.
