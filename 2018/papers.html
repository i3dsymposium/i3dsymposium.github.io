<h3>Papers Program</h3>

<p>
Over the past three decades, the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games has showcased 
exceptional progress from academic and industrial research covering all aspects of interactive computer graphics.
    <!--
This year’s meeting of the symposium (I3D 2018) is being held [when] [where]
-->
</p>

This year, we continue our collaboration with IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. 
    A selection of I3D papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of TVCG. 
    We are also continuing our partnership with the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques. 
    Some papers originally published in JCGT will be presented in the I3D plenary session, 
    and a selection of I3D papers will also be invited to submit extended versions for publication in JCGT.
    We hope these partnerships will continue bringing additional attention to I3D and the quality of the work published here.
</p>
<p>	
Best paper presentation awards will be voted by attendees at the end of the symposium.
