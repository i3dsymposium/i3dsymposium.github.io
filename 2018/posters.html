<h3>Posters and Demos</h3>

<p><b>Submission Deadline: Friday, 9 March 2018, 11:59 IDLW (UTC - 12hrs)</b></p>
<p>Author Notification: 22 March 2018</p>

<p>I3D is the leading conference for real time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. This year marks the 32nd year since the first conference. The conference will be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.</p>

<p>We invite authors to submit posters of their cutting edge work in interactive 3D graphics and games. Authors may submit work-in-progress that is not yet mature enough to appear in a short or long paper. We also welcome recent work that has been published elsewhere, but is relevant to the I3D community. Authors with accepted posters will present their poster in-person at the conference, and will also have the opportunity to summarize their work in front of a larger audience during a poster “fast-forward” session.</p>

<p>Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li>Interaction devices and techniques</li>
<li>3D game techniques</li>
<li>Virtual and augmented reality</li>
<li>Interactive modeling</li>
<li>Level-of-detail approaches</li>
<li>Pre-computed lighting</li>
<li>Visibility computation</li>
<li>Real-time surface shading</li>
<li>Fast shadows, caustics and reflections</li>
<li>Imposters and image-based techniques</li>
<li>Animated models</li>
<li>Physics-based animation</li>
<li>GPU techniques</li>
<li>Navigation methods</li>
<li>Interactive visualization</li>
<li>User studies of interactive techniques and applications</li>
<li>Sketch-based 3D interaction</li>
</ol></p>

<p><b>Awards</b></p>

<p>Two poster awards and prizes (NVIDIA GPUs) will be presented at the conference. The awards will be given to best posters for unpublished work involving a student author.</p>
