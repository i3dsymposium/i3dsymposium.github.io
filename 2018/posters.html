<h3>Posters</h3>

    <p><b>Submission Deadline: to be announced</b></p>

    <p><b>What to submit?</b><br>
    Poster and demo submissions should consist of an extended abstract
    in PDF format. The abstract can be one or two pages. The abstract must follow the ACM SIGGRAPH formatting
    guidelines for poster abstracts (linked below).
	All extended abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital
    Library (DL). Note that this still allows you to submit your work as a full
    paper to another conference or journal (or a future I3D conference).</p>

    <p><b>How to submit?</b><br>
    Please e-mail your submission to
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
    var Foo = "i3dsymposium.org";
    var Bar = "mail" + "to:" + "posters@" + Foo;
    document.write("<a href=\"" + Bar + "\"" + ">");
    document.write("posters@" + Foo);
    document.write("<\/a>");
    </script>
    </p>
    <p>
    Include a one or two page abstract; other supplementary material (under 25MB)
    may optionally be attached to your e-mail.  If your supplementary material 
    will be larger than 25 MB, please check with the Posters Chair to discuss
    possible arrangements <i>prior</i> to the submission deadline.
