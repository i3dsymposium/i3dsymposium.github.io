<h3>Conference Venue</h3>

<p>The conference will be held at the offices of Ubisoft Montréal. 
[map here]

<p>Please note: I3D attendees should <i>not</i> use Ubisoft’s main entrance on St. Laurent street. Instead, use the rear entrance to the studio, located 1 block east of St. Laurent on St. Dominique street, just south of St. Viateur, on the west side, as shown <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VAdpitUXNmm">here</a>.

<h3>Lodging</h3>
There is no official I3D hotel. We recommend lodging at any downtown hotel of your choice.


<h3>Transportation</h3>

Attendees are responsible for their own transportation to Ubisoft’s Montréal studio. There are three main options if traveling from the downtown hotels: 
<ol>
<li>Metro: take the Orange line north (in direction “Montmorency”) until Station Laurier. From there, it’s a 15 minute walk. [<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8PcBUqccppo">map</a>]

<li>Take Bus 80 north, along avenue Parc, until St. Viateur (roughly 25 minutes); then, walk east to St. Dominique (roughly 5 minutes) and turn right (south) until the rear entrance.

<li>Take Bus 55 north, along St. Laurent, until St. Viateur (again, roughly 25 minutes), which will be right at the main Ubisoft entrance; then, walk east along St. Viateur to St. Dominique (1 block: 30 seconds) and turn right (south) until the rear entrance.
