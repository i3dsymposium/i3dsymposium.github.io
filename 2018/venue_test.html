<h3>Conference Venue</h3>

<p>The conference will be held at the offices of Ubisoft Montréal. 

<p>Please note: I3D attendees should <i>not</i> use Ubisoft’s main entrance on St. Laurent Street. Instead, use the rear entrance to the studio, located at 5480 St Dominique Street. This is one block east of St. Laurent on St. Dominique, just south of St. Viateur, on the west side, as shown <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VAdpitUXNmm">here</a>.

<h3>Lodging</h3>
There is no official I3D hotel. We recommend lodging at any downtown hotel of your choice.


<h3>Transportation</h3>

Attendees are responsible for their own transportation to Ubisoft’s Montréal studio. There are three main options if traveling from the downtown hotels: 
<ol>
<li>Metro: take the Orange line north (in direction “Montmorency”) until Station Laurier. From there, it’s a 15 minute walk. [<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8PcBUqccppo">map</a>]

<li>Take Bus 80 north, along Avenue Parc, until St. Viateur (roughly 25 minutes); then, walk east to St. Dominique (roughly 5 minutes) and turn right (south) until the rear entrance.

<li>Take Bus 55 north, along St. Laurent, until St. Viateur (again, roughly 25 minutes), which will be right at the main Ubisoft entrance; then, walk east along St. Viateur to St. Dominique (1 block: 30 seconds) and turn right (south) until the rear entrance.
