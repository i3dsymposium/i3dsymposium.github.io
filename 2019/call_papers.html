<hr>

<p><h4>Submission Information</h4></p>

<p>Research papers should be in <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM conference format</a>. They should contain at most <b>eight (8) pages</b> of content, including appendices and excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation. Submissions should be converted to PDF and uploaded via the submission website: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2019</a></p>

<p>There is a single track for paper submission and authors will present a 20-minute talk on each accepted paper at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to also present their work during the posters session to give their co-authors an opportunity to present.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double blind peer review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process.</p>

<p>The international program committee will designate each accepted paper as a “Journal Paper” or “Conference Paper.” This decision will be based on the maturity of the work and its presentation, not the magnitude of the contribution. The ACM will publish journal papers immediately in a special issue of the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM) journal. PACM papers will have mandatory changes and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer to verify these changes. Conference papers will appear in the I3D’19 conference proceedings in the ACM digital library and are fast-tracked for an extended revision with 30% content changed in the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT). Page limits will be relaxed for the final versions on both tracks.</p>

<p><b>Late-breaking re-submissions</b></p>
This year, the Eurographics paper notifications are just after the I3D deadline. To accommodate authors who wish to re-submit papers rejected from other venues, authors of papers from EG, ToG, and other venues may re-submit their work to I3D at the extended date of 22 Dec 2018, without formatting or page limits. These papers must include a 1-page cover letter explaining what changes the authors have made to the current version since their original submission, and unedited versions of all of the reviews and the summary decision. If these papers are accepted at I3D, the authors will be required to be reformat them in the ACM template.</p>

<hr>

<p><h4>Important Dates</h4></p>
<p>All deadlines are 8 pm Eastern Time<br/>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>Paper submission deadline:  15 December 2018</li>
<li>Extension for EG papers (see details above):  22 December 2018  </li>
<li>Notification of committee decisions:  15 February 2019 </li>
<li>Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers:  1 March 2019 </li>
<ul></p>

<p>Authors may choose to withdraw their submission after notification of acceptance status. Accepted work will be presented at the conference during oral sessions or as posters during a poster session. Submissions deemed incomplete, inappropriate, or otherwise unacceptable may be desk rejected by the papers or posters chairs without review by the committee. Accepted journal paper authors may instead elect to be published as conference papers.</p>

<p>The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)</p>

<p>All questions about paper submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:papers@i3dsymposium.org">papers@i3dsymposium.org</a> </p>
