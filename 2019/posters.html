<h3>Posters</h3>

<p>Poster submission deadline: <br>
March 11, 2019 (11:59 IDLW, UTC - 12hrs)
</p>

<p>Author notification:<br>
March 25, 2019</p>

<p>We invite authors to submit posters of their cutting edge work in interactive 3D graphics and games.  Authors may submit work-in-progress that is not yet mature enough to appear as full paper. We also welcome recent work that has been published elsewhere, but is relevant to the I3D community. Authors with accepted posters will present their poster in-person at the conference, and will also have the opportunity to summarize their work in front of a larger audience
 during a poster “fast-forward” session.</p>


<p><b>Awards</b></p>

<p>Two poster awards will be given for unpublished works: best poster and best student poster.</p>

<p><b>Submission details</b></p>

<p>Please submit an abstract (maximum 2 pages) in PDF format to the submission system:<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2019</a>
 </p>

<p>Poster submissions will be reviewed single-blind, so author information should be included. If the work has been published elsewhere, the citation and venue should be identified in the abstract. Submissions should adhere to the ACM SIGGRAPH formatting guidelines. Posters will not appear in the official I3D proceedings or in the ACM Digital library, but will appear in an online database for distribution at the author’s discretion.
 </p>


<p>All questions about poster submissions should be emailed to 
I3D 2019 Posters Chair Dan Casas, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain)
