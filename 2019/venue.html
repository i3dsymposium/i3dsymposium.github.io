<h3>Lodging</h3>
<p>
Currently, there is no official I3D 2019 hotel. 

Please note that I3D conference dates will overlap with <a href="https://www.icra2019.org/">ICRA 2019</a>. It is therefore likely there will be a reduced availability of rooms.
</p>
<h4>We recommend booking your accomodations early!</h4> 

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>
Attendees are responsible for their own transportation to and from Unity's Montreal office. There are several options if traveling from the downtown area: 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Metro:</b> The closest metro (subway) station is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/h2abWXtGXoN2">Charlevoix</a>, which is a 10 minute walk from Unity's offices.

<li><b>Bicycle:</b> Bixi is Montréal's public bicycle sharing system. There are stations located within a few blocks of Unity offices at Rue Shearer and Rue Richardson. Bike paths on the nearby Lachine Canal give easy travel access in the east and west directions.

<li><b>Taxi / Uber:</b> Cab services such as <a href="https://teo.taxi/en/">Téo Taxi</a> and Uber may be booked directly from your smartphone.
