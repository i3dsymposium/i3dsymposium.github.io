    The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference
    for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction.
</p>

<p>
    In the 34 years since its first edition, the conference has hosted numerous seminal articles on rendering,
    texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and other areas of real-time computer
    graphics. The conference is a welcoming venue for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to
    discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications.
</p>

    We invite you to submit papers about interaction, interactive 3D graphics, and games.
    Topics include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul class="unstyled">
    <li>Physics-based animation</li>

<h4>Papers Summary</h4>
    13 December 2019 deadline
<br>
    8 pages + references
<br>
    anonymous submission
<br>
    special extension for re-submissions

<h4>Submission and Review</h4>
<p>
    Research papers should be in
    <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">
        ACM conference
        format
    </a> using the “sigconf” style.
    They should contain at most eight (8) pages of content, including appendices
    but excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and
    optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are
    required for techniques involving motion or animation.
</p>

<p>
    Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present a 20 minute talk on their
    work, and at least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the
    conference.
</p>

<p>
    Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer
    review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary
    reviewers. There is no rebuttal process.
</p>

<p>
    The international program committee will designate each accepted paper as a
    “Journal Paper” or “Conference Paper.” This decision will be based on the maturity
    of the work and its presentation, not the magnitude of the contribution. The ACM
    will publish journal papers in a special issue of the Proceedings of the ACM in
    Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACM CGIT). PACM papers will have
    mandatory changes and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer to
    verify these changes. Conference papers will appear in the I3D ’20 conference
    proceedings in the ACM Digital Library and are fast-tracked for an extended
    revision with 30% content changed in the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques
    (JCGT). Page limits will be relaxed for the final versions on both tracks.
</p>


<h4>Late-breaking re-submissions</h4>
<p>
    This year, the Eurographics paper notifications coincide with the I3D deadline.
    To accommodate authors who wish to re-submit papers rejected from other venues,
    authors of papers from EG, ToG, and other venues may re-submit their work to I3D
    at the extended date of 20 Dec 2019, without formatting changes or page limits.
    However, these papers must include a 1-page cover letter explaining what changes
    the authors have made to the current version since their original submission,
    along with unedited versions of all of the reviews and the summary decision.
    If these papers are accepted at I3D, the authors will be required to reformat
    them using the ACM template.
<p>

    <h4>Dates</h4>
<p>All deadlines are 8 pm Eastern Time</p>

<h3>Posters</h3>
<p>
    Submit poster submissions as a draft of the poster or a one-page extended abstract.
    Two categories of work are considered:
</p>

<p>
    (i) Work that has been published elsewhere but is of particular relevance to the
    I3D community can be submitted as a poster. This work and the venue in which it
    was published should be identified in the submission.
</p>

<p>
    (ii) Work that is of interest to the I3D community but is not yet mature enough
    to appear as a paper.
</p>

<p>
    All papers will also be considered for acceptance as posters. Posters will
    undergo single-blind review, so author information may be included.
</p>


<p>
    Authors may choose to withdraw their submission after notification of acceptance 
    status. Accepted work will be presented at the conference during oral sessions 
    or as posters during a poster session. Submissions deemed incomplete, inappropriate, 
    or otherwise unacceptable may be desk rejected by the papers or posters chairs 
    without review by the committee. Accepted journal paper authors may instead 
    elect to be published as conference papers.
</p>

<p>
    The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the 
    ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of 
    your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent 
    filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings 
    are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official 
    publication date remains the first day of the conference.)
</p>
