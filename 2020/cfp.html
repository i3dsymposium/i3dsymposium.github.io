<h3>Call for Posters</h3>

<h4>Important Dates</h4>
<p>All deadlines are 8 pm Pacific Time.</p>
<p>
<b>Poster submission deadline</b> March 13, 2020 </br>
<b>Author notification</b> March 29, 2020 </br>

</p>


<p>Authors are invited to submit their recent work as a poster. Topics of interest are: interactive techniques, AR, VR, 
illumination, shading, interactive modeling, image-based techniques, physics simulation, animation, visualization, machine 
learning for graphics and content creation, graphics hardware and user studies covering all enlisted topics. We encourage 
submission of work-in-progress and works published at another venue that are relevant to the I3D community. Accepted 
posters will be presented by the authors in-person at the conference in two separate sessions: as a quick fast forward 
teaser and in-depth discussion with the audience.</p>

<p>I3D will NOT include a dedicated shorts session at this year’s conference. Authors are encouraged to submit their work as 
a poster instead.</p>

<h4>Awards</h4>

<p>The best original works will be awarded in two categories: best poster and best student poster.</p>

<h4>Submission details</h4>

<p>Posters when submitted should be formatted as a 2-page paper adhering to the ACM SIGGRAPH guidelines with authors 
information included. Submissions will be accepted for review electronically at 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d20">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d20</a> . 
They will be reviewed in a single-blind process. After the posters are 
accepted in the conference, they will appear in an online database for distribution at their authors’ discretion. They 
will NOT appear in the I3D proceedings, nor in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>Questions regarding the submission process should be emailed 
to <a href="mailto:posters@i3dsymposium.org">posters@i3dsymposium.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D 
computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals 
to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a 
long legacy of innovative and technically excellent content with seminal work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision 
detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics having been presented at the 
conference. </p>

<p>We welcome you to submit papers about interactive 3D graphics and games. Topics include, but are not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time rendering</li>
<li>Physics-based animation</li>
<li>Virtual and augmented reality</li>
<li>Deep learning for graphics and simulation </li>
<li>Collision detection</li>
<li>Real-time computer vision</li>
<li>Navigation in virtual environments</li>
<li>Texture synthesis</li>
<li>Real-time post-processing effects</li>
<li>Interactive 3D modeling</li>
<li>Level-of-detail approaches</li>
<li>Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications</li>
<li>Visibility computation</li>
<li>Real-time surface shading</li>
<li>Fast shadows, caustics and reflections</li>
<li>Impostors and image-based techniques</li>
<li>Motion synthesis and path planning </li>
<li>Interaction devices and techniques</li>
<li>Interactive visualization</li>
<li>User studies of interactive techniques</li>
<li>Sketch-based 3D interaction</li>
<li>Highly-interactive video game techniques</li>
<li>Content generation techniques for real-time applications</li>
</ul>

<h4>Submission Information</h4>
<p>
Research papers should be in ACM conference format using the “sigconf” style. They should contain at most eight (8) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation. </p>

<p>The ACM LaTeX template for submissions may be downloaded here: <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>
</P> 

<p>Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present a 20 minute talk on their work. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process.</p>

<p>The international program committee will designate each accepted paper as a “Journal Paper” or “Conference Paper”. 
	This decision will be based on the maturity of the work and its presentation, not necessarily the magnitude of 
	the contribution. The ACM will publish journal papers in a special issue of 
	the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/pub.cfm?id=J1615">Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques 
	(PACMCGIT)</a>, whereas conference papers will appear in the I3D ‘20 proceedings. Both journal and conference papers 
	will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>Authors of accepted journal and conference papers will submit the source of their camera-ready article, and supplementary material, to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/taps-best-practices">TAPS</a> for validation and publication.
</p>	

<b>Journal papers</b> <br/>
<p>Papers selected for PACMCGIT will have mandatory changes and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer to verify these changes. Conference papers will be fast-tracked for an extended version with 30% content changed in the <a href="http://jcgt.org/">Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT)</a>. Page limits will be relaxed for the final versions on both tracks.</p>

<b>Late-breaking Re-submissions</b>
<p>
Authors of papers submitted to EG, TOG, and other venues may re-submit their work to I3D without formatting changes or page limits, assuming the work has not been accepted elsewhere. These papers should include a 1-page cover letter explaining what changes the authors have made to the current version since their original submission, along with unedited versions of all of the reviews and the summary decision. If these papers are accepted at I3D, the authors will be required to reformat them using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM template</a>.</p>

<h4>Important Dates</h4>
<p>All deadlines are 8 pm Pacific Time.</p>
<p>
<b>20 December 2019</b>  Paper submission deadline <br/>
<!-- <b>20 December 2019</b>  Extension for re-submissions (see details above) <br/> -->
<b>14 February 2020</b>  Notification of committee decisions<br/>
<b>28 February 2020</b>  Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers<br/>
<b>09 March 2020</b>     Poster submission deadline<br/>
</p>

<p>
Authors may choose to withdraw their submission after notification of acceptance status. Accepted work will be presented at the conference during oral sessions or as posters during a poster session. Submissions deemed incomplete, inappropriate, or otherwise unacceptable may be desk rejected by the papers or posters chairs without review by the committee. Accepted journal paper authors may instead elect to be published as conference papers.</p>

<p>The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference. </p>

<p>All questions about paper submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:papers@i3dsymposium.org">papers@i3dsymposium.org</a>. </p>
