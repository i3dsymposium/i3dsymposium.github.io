	<p><b>Bio:</b> <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/">Ming Lin</a> is an American computer scientist and the chair of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she also holds an endowed faculty position as the Elizabeth Stevinson Iribe Chair of Computer Science. Prior to moving to Maryland in 2018, Lin was the John R. &amp; Louise S. Parker Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
	
	<p>Lin is known for her work on collision detection, and in particular for the Linâ€“Canny algorithm for maintaining the closest pair of features of two moving objects, for the idea (with Cohen, Manocha, and Ponamgi) of using axis-aligned bounding boxes to quickly eliminate from consideration pairs of objects that are far from colliding, and for additional speedups to collision detection using bounding box hierarchies. Her software libraries implementing these algorithms are widely used in commercial applications including computer aided design and computer games. More generally, her research interests are in physically based modeling, haptics, robotics, 3D computer graphics, computational geometry, and interactive computer simulation.</p>
