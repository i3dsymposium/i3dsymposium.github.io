	<p><b>Bio:</b> <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/">Ming Lin</a> is an American computer scientist and the chair of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she also holds an endowed faculty position as the Elizabeth Stevinson Iribe Chair of Computer Science. Prior to moving to Maryland in 2018, Lin was the John R. &amp; Louise S. Parker Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
	
	<p>Lin is known for her work on collision detection, and in particular for the Lin–Canny algorithm for maintaining the closest pair of features of two moving objects, for the idea (with Cohen, Manocha, and Ponamgi) of using axis-aligned bounding boxes to quickly eliminate from consideration pairs of objects that are far from colliding, and for additional speedups to collision detection using bounding box hierarchies. Her software libraries implementing these algorithms are widely used in commercial applications including computer aided design and computer games. More generally, her research interests are in physically based modeling, haptics, robotics, 3D computer graphics, computational geometry, and interactive computer simulation.</p>

	<p><b>Bio:</b> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-rose-6905a12/">Rachel Rose</a>, an R&amp;D Supervisor at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), drives technology that aids artists in the creation and animation of characters for feature films. Rachel has a strong interest in the intersection of real-time technology and the film industry that started with her Ph.D. thesis on real-time motion synthesis. In her 12 years at ILM, Rachel has worked on a wide range of films, TV shows, and video games, including <I>Rango</I> (2011), <I>Noah</I> (2014), <I>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)</I>, <I>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2 (2010)</I>, and, most recently, as ILM Technology Supervisor for <I>The Mandalorian</I> (2019). Rachel is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), and her work on BlockParty, a visual, procedural rigging system, earned her a Technical Achievement Award from AMPAS in 2018.</p>

	<p><b>Bio:</b> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natyhoffman/">Naty Hoffman</a>
	is a Principal Engineer &amp; Architect in the Advanced Development Group at Lucasfilm,
	where he has helped drive real-time rendering technology on multiple projects including <I>The Mandalorian</I>
	TV show, the <I>Smuggler’s Run</I> theme park ride, and the Virtual Reality experiences <I>Secrets of the Empire</I>
	and <I>Vader Immortal</I>. Naty joined Lucasfilm in early 2016 after two decades in the game industry, during
	which he played a key role in bringing advances such as physically based shading and cinematic color
	grading to game production. Naty's contributions include graphics technology for celebrated game
	franchises such as <I>Call of Duty</I> and <I>God of War</I>, core technology libraries for Sony's Playstation 3
	console, and influential publications including the <I>Physics and Math of Shading</I> talks at SIGGRAPH and
	the book <I>Real-Time Rendering</I>.</p>
