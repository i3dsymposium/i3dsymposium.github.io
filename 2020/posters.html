<P>Posters at the virtual conference should be a unique experience, as the Chair is designing a virtual space for presenting and viewing them, using <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Hubs</a>. Here is a sneak peek of a bit of the space:</P>

<div style="display: block; margin-left: 20px; width: 40%;">
    <p class="text-center" align="center"><img src="img/poster_space.jpg" width="600"></p>
</div>


<p>All questions about posters and poster presentations should be directed to 
I3D 2020 Posters Chair <a href="committee.html">Zdravko Velinov</a>.</p>
