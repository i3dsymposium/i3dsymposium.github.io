<h3>Posters</h3>

<p>See the <a href="cfp.html">Call For Participation</a> for information on submissions and deadlines. Key date: <B>August 9, 2020</B> is the new posters deadline.</p>

<P>Posters at the virtual conference should be a unique experience, as the Chair is designing a virtual space for presenting and viewing them, using <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Hubs</a>. Here is a sneak peek of a bit of the space:</P>
