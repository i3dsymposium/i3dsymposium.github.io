<h3>Posters</h3>

<p>On <a href="program.html">Monday, September 14</a>, each poster author will give a pre-recorded
    fast-forward of their results, then on <a href="program.html">Wednesday, September 16</a> present their posters to attendees in a virtual reality environment (don't worry - you can use your browser, too). You will <a href="https://bit.ly/i3d2020reg">need to register</a> to enter this space. This space is open now. It doubles as I3D's social room for breaks and after hours.</p>

<P>Posters at the virtual conference will be a unique experience, as the Chair is designing a virtual space for presenting and viewing them, using <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Hubs</a>. Here is a sneak peek of a bit of the world:</P>

<div style="display: block; margin-left: 20px; width: 40%;">
    <p class="text-center" align="center"><img src="img/poster_space.jpg" width="600"></p>
</div>


<p>All questions about posters and poster presentations should be directed to 
I3D 2020 Posters Chair <a href="committee.html">Zdravko Velinov</a>.</p>
