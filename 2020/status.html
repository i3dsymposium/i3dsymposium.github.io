<p><I>Last updated March 21, 2020</I></p>

<p>Having I3D 2020 at its original time and place is no longer an option. Closer to the event we expect to schedule I3D 2020 for a time slot in September or later at the same location, <a href="venue.html">ILMâ€™s Premier Theater</a> in the Presidio, San Francisco. We are tentatively scheduled for September 15-17, but will be checking with ILM after April 15th as the situation and their plans evolve.
</p>

<p>Papers accepted to PACMCGIT and to the Proceedings will be published following the original timeframe. Some time around May 5th there will be a two week open access period where all papers in the Proceedings will be available to all freely. There will also be a similar two week period after the conference is held in the fall.
</p>

<p>
Posters that are accepted will not be published in any form at this time. If you are an author of a poster, you have the option to present during the new conference time slot or withdraw your submission. Please send your decision to <a href="mailto:posters@i3dsymposium.org">posters@i3dsymposium.org</a>. The posters submission deadline is extended at this point to at earliest August 2nd.
