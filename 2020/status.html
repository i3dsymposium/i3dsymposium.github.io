<p><I>Last updated April 27, 2020</I></p>

<p>Having I3D 2020 at its original time and place is no longer an option. We are tentatively scheduled for September 15-17 for a physical conference at <a href="venue.html">ILMâ€™s Premier Theater</a> in the Presidio, San Francisco. Given current forecasts, currently the odds are low for this event to be held physically. However, we are a conference with a small footprint, so do not need to make any decisions until at earliest the end of June. At that point we'll know more than we do now, both about travel conditions and other possibilities, such as a virtual conference. Whatever option is chosen will happen in September or thereafter.
</p>

<p>Papers accepted to PACMCGIT and to the Proceedings will be published following the original timeframe. Some time around May 5th there will be a two week open access period where all papers in the Proceedings will be available to all freely. There will also be a similar two week period after the conference is held in the fall.
</p>

<p>
Posters that are accepted will not be published in any form at this time. If you are an author of a poster, you have the option to present during the new conference time slot or withdraw your submission. Please send your decision to <a href="mailto:posters@i3dsymposium.org">posters@i3dsymposium.org</a>. The posters submission deadline is extended at this point to at earliest August 2nd.
