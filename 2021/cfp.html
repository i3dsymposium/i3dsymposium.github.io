<h3>Call for Posters</h3>

<h4>Important Dates</h4>
<p>All deadlines are 8 pm Pacific Time.</p>
<p>
<b>Poster submission deadline</b> August 9, 2021 </br>
<b>Author notification</b> August 16, 2021 </br>

</p>


<p>Authors are invited to submit their recent work as a poster. Topics of interest are: interactive techniques, AR, VR, 
illumination, shading, interactive modeling, image-based techniques, physics simulation, animation, visualization, machine 
learning for graphics and content creation, graphics hardware and user studies covering all enlisted topics. We encourage 
submission of work-in-progress and works published at another venue that are relevant to the I3D community. Accepted 
posters will be presented by the authors in-person at the conference in two separate sessions: as a quick fast forward 
teaser and in-depth discussion with the audience.</p>

<p>I3D will NOT include a dedicated shorts session at this year’s conference. Authors are encouraged to submit their work as 
a poster instead.</p>

<h4>Awards</h4>

<p>The best original works will be awarded in two categories: best poster and best student poster.</p>

<h4>Submission details</h4>

<p>Posters when submitted should be formatted as a 2-page paper adhering to the ACM SIGGRAPH guidelines with authors 
information included. Submissions will be accepted for review electronically at 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d20">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d20</a> . 
They will be reviewed in a single-blind process. After the posters are 
accepted in the conference, they will appear in an online database for distribution at their authors’ discretion. They 
will NOT appear in the I3D proceedings, nor in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>Questions regarding the submission process should be emailed 
to <a href="mailto:posters@i3dsymposium.org">posters@i3dsymposium.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics having been presented at the conference.</p>

<p>We invite you to submit papers about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time rendering</li>
<li>Physics-based animation</li>
<li>Virtual and augmented reality</li>
<li>Deep learning for graphics and simulation</li>
<li>Collision detection</li>
<li>Real-time computer vision</li>
<li>Navigation in virtual environments</li>
<li>Texture synthesis</li>
<li>Real-time post-processing effects</li>
<li>Interactive 3D modeling</li>
<li>In-the-wild 3D reconstruction</li>
<li>Level-of-detail approaches</li>
<li>Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications</li>
<li>Visibility computation</li>
<li>Real-time surface shading</li>
<li>Fast shadows, caustics and reflections</li>
<li>Impostors and image-based techniques</li>
<li>Motion synthesis and path planning</li>
<li>Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques</li>
<li>Interaction devices and techniques</li>
<li>User studies of interactive techniques</li>
<li>Sketch-based 3D modeling and design</li>
<li>Video game techniques</li>
<li>Content generation techniques for real-time applications</li>
</ul>

<P>
<I><B>Summary:</B> 22 December 2020 deadline; 8 pages + references; anonymous submission</I>

<h4>Submission Information</h4>
<p>
Research papers should be in <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM conference format</a> using the “sigconf” style. They should contain at most eight (8) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.</p>

<p>Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present a 15 minute talk on their work. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process.</p>

<p>The international program committee will designate each accepted paper as a “Journal Paper” or “Conference Paper.” This decision will be based on the maturity of the work and its presentation, not necessarily the magnitude of the contribution. The ACM will publish journal papers in a special issue of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit"><I>Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques</I> (PACM CGIT)</a>, whereas conference papers will appear in the I3D ‘21 proceedings. Both journal and conference papers will be archived in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a>.</p>

<p>Authors of accepted journal and conference papers will submit the source of their camera-ready article, and supplementary material, to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/taps-best-practices">TAPS</a> for validation and publication.
</p>	

<b>Journal papers</b> <br/>
<p>PACM journal papers will have mandatory changes and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer to verify these changes. Conference papers will be fast-tracked for an extended version with 30% content changed in the <a href="http://jcgt.org/"><I>Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques</i> (JCGT)</a>. Page limits will be relaxed for the final versions on both tracks.</p>

<p>All deadlines are 23:59 PM Pacific Time.</p>
