<p>On <a href="program.html">Monday, September 14</a>, each poster author gave a pre-recorded
    fast-forward of their results, then on <a href="program.html">Wednesday, September 16</a> presented their posters to attendees in a virtual reality environment (don't worry - you can use your browser, too). You will <a href="https://bit.ly/i3d2020reg">need to register</a> to enter this space. This space is open now. It doubles as I3D's social room for breaks and after hours.</p>
