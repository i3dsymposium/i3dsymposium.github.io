</ul>

<p>We encourage submission of work-in-progress and works published at another venue that are relevant to the I3D community. Accepted posters will be presented by the authors at the conference in two separate sessions: as a quick fast forward teaser and in-depth discussion with the audience in a virtual poster session.
</p>

<h4>Awards</h4>

<p>The best poster presentation done by a student will be awarded. As prize, we hand out one AMD GPU, courtesy of our sponsor AMD.</p>

<h4>Submission Information</h4>

<p>Poster submissions should be in <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM conference format</a> using the “sigconf” style. They should include author information and must not be longer than two pages. Submissions will be submitted for review electronically at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2021</a>. They will be reviewed in a single-blind process. After the posters are accepted in the conference, they will appear in an online database for distribution at their authors’ discretion. They will NOT appear in the I3D proceedings, nor in the ACM Digital Library.</p>


<p>Questions regarding the submission process should be emailed 
to <a href="mailto:posters@i3dsymposium.org">posters@i3dsymposium.org</a>.</p>

<p><I><B>Summary:</B> 22 December 2021 deadline; 8 pages + references; anonymous submission; submission link <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22</a></I></p>

<p>The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics having been presented at the conference.</p>

<p>We invite you to <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22">submit papers</a> about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

<h4>Submission Information</h4>
<p>
Research papers should be in <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM conference format</a> using the “sigconf” style. They should contain at most eight (8) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.</p>

<p>Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present a 15 minute talk on their work. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process. The submission system link is <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22</a></p>

<p>All accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit">Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACM CGIT)</a>, once all mandatory changes have been addressed and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer is passed.</p>
