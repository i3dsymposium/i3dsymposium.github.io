For the logo, there is an img/logo.xcf file which is the layered
logo in the GIMP file format. The text is on two separate editable
layers. For the drop shadow:

(2022 -- GIMP seems to have changed the parameters a bit)
 - Duplicate the previous year's text layer and update its text. 
 - Delete the old one, and its drop shadow

 - With the new text layer selected, from the Filters menu, select Light and Shadow >> Drop Shadow...

 - In the Drop Shadow dialog, 
      Set Offset X and Offset Y to 4 and Blur Radius to 3
      Set Opacity to 0.7 (70%.)
