To create the banner for the current year, you need 2 things:

- Inkscape installed and accessible through your PATH https://inkscape.org
- Python

In a terminal, open the /img_src directory, and run
$ python banner.py <current_year>

This will create a banner.png file in the /<current_year>/ directory
