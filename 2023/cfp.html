<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p><I><B>Summary:</B> 22 December 2021 deadline; 8 pages + references; anonymous submission; submission link <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22</a></I></p>

<p>The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics having been presented at the conference.</p>

<p>We invite you to <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22">submit papers</a> about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time rendering</li>
<li>Physics-based animation</li>
<li>Virtual and augmented reality</li>
<li>Deep learning for graphics and simulation</li>
<li>Collision detection</li>
<li>Real-time computer vision</li>
<li>Navigation in virtual environments</li>
<li>Texture synthesis</li>
<li>Real-time post-processing effects</li>
<li>Interactive 3D modeling</li>
<li>In-the-wild 3D reconstruction</li>
<li>Level-of-detail approaches</li>
<li>Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications</li>
<li>Visibility computation</li>
<li>Real-time surface shading</li>
<li>Fast shadows, caustics and reflections</li>
<li>Impostors and image-based techniques</li>

<h4>Submission Information</h4>
<p>
Research papers should be in <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM conference format</a> using the “sigconf” style. They should contain at most eight (8) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.</p>

<p>Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present a 15 minute talk on their work. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process. The submission system link is <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d22</a></p>

<p>All accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit">Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACM CGIT)</a>, once all mandatory changes have been addressed and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer is passed.</p>

<h4>Important Dates</h4>
<p>All deadlines are 23:59 PM Pacific Time.</p>
