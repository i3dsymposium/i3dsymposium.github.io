<h3>Steering Committee</h3>

<p>The steering committee consists of the conference and general
co-chairs of the most recent 4 years, including the chairs of the
upcoming conference that is still being planned.</p>

<p>For 2023, this is<br>
  <ul>
    {% for year in page.steering_committee -%}
    <!-- {{ year.year }} -->
    {% for member in year.members -%}
    <li>{{ member }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</p>

<p>In general, we expect that a junior and senior person will serve as
co-chairs for the conference and a similar team will serve as co-chairs
for the program.  This guideline allows junior members of the community
to gain exposure by participating in the conference organization.</p>

<p>The general chairs for each year's conference become the next year's
program chairs, unless they step down, in which case they can be replaced.
The following year's general chairs are selected and recruited by the current
chairs, with input and approval by the steering committee.</p>

<p>The steering committee is also responsible for making long-term strategic
decisions, such as those related to the publication format and timing.</p>
