    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p>
        TBA
    </p>

    <h5>Bio</h5>
    <p>
        Natalya Tatarchuk (@mirror2mask) is a graphics engineer and a rendering enthusiast at heart, currently focusing on driving the state-of-the-art rendering technology, graphics performance and character content creation in her role as a Distinguished Technical Fellow and Chief Architect, VP, Wētā Tools at Unity.
        <br>
        Prior to that, led the Graphics team at Unity, as VP of Graphics for the Unity Editor and Engine. Before that she was a AAA games developer, working on innovative cross-platform rendering engine and game graphics for Bungie's Destiny franchise, as well the Halo series, such as Halo: ODST and Halo: Reach, and AMD Graphics Products Group where she pushed parallel computing boundaries investigating advanced real-time graphics techniques, and graphics hardware design and APIs.
        <br>
        Natalya has been encouraging sharing in the games graphics community for several decades, largely by organizing a popular series of courses such as [Advances in Real-time Rendering](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/), [Open Problems in Real-Time Rendering](http://openproblems.realtimerendering.com/) and [Rendering Engine Architecture](http://enginearchitecture.realtimerendering.com/) at SIGGRAPH, and convincing people to speak there. It seems to be working.

    <h3 id="Keynote3">Blurring the Line between Physics and Imagination: A Glimpse of Neural Rendering's Future</h3>
    <h4>Marco Salvi, Principal Research Scientist, NVIDIA</h4>
	<img src="img/marcosalvi_headshot.jpg" class="keynote-headshot" style="max-width:250px;">
    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p>
        TBA
    </p>

    <h5>Bio</h5>
    <p>
		Marco Salvi is a Principal Research Scientist at NVIDIA, where he works on developing high-performance software and hardware rendering algorithms for the post-Moore's law era. 
		<br>
		His research interests span a broad range of topics, from anti-aliasing and order-independent transparency to ray tracing hardware, texture compression and neural rendering. Marco has made numerous contributions to rendering APIs, including raster order views and micro-meshes, and his early work on real-time neural image reconstruction has led to the development of NVIDIA DLSS. 
		<br>
		Prior to becoming a researcher, Marco worked at Ninja Theory and LucasArts architecting advanced graphics engines, performing low-level optimizations and developing new rendering techniques for games on two generations of Playstation and XBOX consoles.
		<br>
		Marco holds an M.S. in Physics from the University of Bologna, Italy.
