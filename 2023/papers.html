        abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have revolutionized novel view synthesis for captured scenes, with recent methods allowing interactive free-viewpoint navigation and fast training for scene reconstruction. However, the implicit representations used by these methods—often including neural networks and complex encodings— make them difficult to edit. Some initial methods have been proposed, but they suffer from limited editing capabilities and/or from a lack of interactivity, and are thus unsuitable for interactive editing of captured scenes. We tackle both limitations and introduce NeRFshop, a novel end-to-end method that allows users to interactively select and deform objects through cage-based transformations. NeRFshop provides fine scribble- based user control for the selection of regions or objects to edit, semi-automatic cage creation, and interactive volumetric manipulation of scene content thanks to our GPU-friendly two-level interpolation scheme. Further, we introduce a preliminary approach that reduces potential resulting artifacts of these transformations with a volumetric membrane interpolation technique inspired by Poisson image editing and provide a process that
“distills” the edits into a standalone NeRF representation.

<h3>Papers Program</h3>

<p>
<em>The following list of papers is not yet organized into sessions. Once the program is fully scheduled, we will add that information. Abstracts for each of the papers will be added soon. Links to the preprints will also be provided in the future.</em>
</p>

<p>
Over the past three decades, the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games has showcased 
exceptional progress from academic and industrial research covering all aspects of interactive computer graphics.
</p>

<p>
This year, we continue a track record of excellence with 16 high-quality papers selected by the international paper committee for publication and presentation at the conference.
<!-- Paper presentations will be streamed daily on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/I3DSymposium">I3D YouTube channel</a> during the conference.
Almost all presentations will be archived and available afterwards. All papers will be presented one after the other in each session, followed by moderated Q &amp; A for all of them.-->
</p>

<p>
Conference papers will appear in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/loi/pacmcgit" target="_blank">PACM CGIT</a> after the conference. We have requested authors to provide preprint links as possible until then. Refresh this page periodically, or use <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/detect-website-change-notification/" target="_blank">a web page monitoring tool</a>, to check this page for updates.
