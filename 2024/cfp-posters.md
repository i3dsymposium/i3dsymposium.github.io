*__Summary:__ 15 March 2024 deadline; submission format: Either 2 page extended abstract using the ["sigconf"](https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors) style OR a complete 24x36 inch poster; submission link <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2024>*


The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics, having been presented at the conference.

We encourage submission of work-in-progress, demos, and works published at another venue that are relevant to the I3D community. Accepted posters will be displayed at the conference. In-person attendance of at least one author is expected.

Authors are invited to submit their recent work about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games as a poster. Topics include, but are not limited to:
 
- Real-time rendering
- Real-time ray tracing and path tracing
- Physics-based animation
- Virtual and augmented reality
- Deep learning for graphics and simulation
- Collision detection
- Real-time computer vision
- Navigation in virtual environments
- Texture synthesis
- Real-time post-processing effects
- Interactive 3D modeling
- In-the-wild 3D reconstruction
- Level-of-detail approaches
- Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications
- Visibility computation
- Real-time surface shading
- Fast shadows, caustics and reflections
- Impostors and image-based techniques
- Motion synthesis and path planning
- Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques
- Interaction devices and techniques
- User studies of interactive techniques
- Sketch-based 3D modeling and design
- Video game techniques
- Content generation techniques for real-time applications


# Submission Information

Poster submissions should be either in the form of an extended abstract or as a final poster. The extended abstract should use the ACM conference format with the ["sigconf"](https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors) style. Posters should be 24x36 inches / approximately A1 size. Submissions will be submitted for review electronically at <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2024>. They will be reviewed in a single-blind process. After the posters are accepted in the conference, they will appear in an online database for distribution at their authors' discretion. Accepted poster authors are expected to provide a brief teaser video (30 seconds), to participate in an in-person fast-forward session at the conference and to bring a physical copy of the poster to the conference. The conference will also include a poster session, with a Q&A opportunity with the post authors. Posters will NOT appear in the I3D proceedings, nor in the ACM Digital Library.


## Awards

The best accepted student poster will be awarded. Information about the prize will be announced later.

Last year, the best poster prize was awarded to "A lightweight 3D viewer: real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D surface models" by Rui Li (Sorbonne University). The poster can be found on the [I3D 2023 website](https://i3dsymposium.org/2023/posters.html).
