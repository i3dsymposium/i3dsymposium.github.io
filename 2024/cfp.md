## Call for Papers


*__Summary:__ 5 of January 2024 deadline; at most 16 pages + references (shorter submissions are welcome); anonymous submission; submission link <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2024>*


The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics, having been presented at the conference.

We invite you to submit papers about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games. Submissions from industry and outside of academia are welcome. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Real-time rendering
- Real-time ray tracing and path tracing
- Physics-based animation
- Virtual and augmented reality
- Deep learning for graphics and simulation
- Collision detection
- Real-time computer vision
- Navigation in virtual environments
- Texture synthesis
- Real-time post-processing effects
- Interactive 3D modeling
- In-the-wild 3D reconstruction
- Level-of-detail approaches
- Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications
- Visibility computation
- Real-time surface shading
- Fast shadows, caustics and reflections
- Impostors and image-based techniques
- Motion synthesis and path planning
- Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques
- Interaction devices and techniques
- User studies of interactive techniques
- Sketch-based 3D modeling and design
- Video game techniques
- Content generation techniques for real-time applications



### Submission Information

Research papers should be in [ACM conference format](https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors) using the **ACM small trim** journal size ("acmsmall"). They should contain at most sixteen (16) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. Optional supplemental material does not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.

There is a single track for paper submission, and authors will be asked to present a 15-20 minute talk on each accepted paper at the conference. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to optionally present their work during the posters session.

Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international paper committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process. The submission system link is: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2024>

All accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the [Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACM CGIT)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit), once all mandatory changes have been addressed and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer is passed.

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
