## COVID-19 Information

All attendees agree to respect and obey the health requirements - at the federal, state, county, city, and venue levels.

Mask wearing is appreciated but not required unless health requirements change from now to the time of the event.

We ask attendees that feel unwell, are diagnosed, or test positive to COVID-19 right before or during the event, not to travel to the event or, if already on-site, to stay at the hotel and not attend the event, to avoid exposing others. See below in the ACM disclosure for what to do if you attended and tested positive after.

Please check the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">website</a> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for the latest information and guidelines (for reference, Bellevue is in King County, Washington).
