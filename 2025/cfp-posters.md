Submission deadline extended to 21 March
{:.large-text}

*__Summary:__ 21 March 2025 deadline; submission format: Either (preferably) 2-page extended abstract using the ["sigconf"](https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors) style, OR, (alternatively) a complete 24x36 inch poster; submission link: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2025>*


The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics, having been presented at the conference.

We encourage submission of work-in-progress, demos, app prototypes with novel techniques and updates of works published at another venue that are relevant to the I3D community. Accepted posters will be displayed at the conference. Registration and in-person attendance of at least one author is expected.

Authors are invited to submit their recent work about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games as a poster. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Real-time rendering
- Real-time ray tracing and path tracing
- Physics-based animation
- Virtual and augmented reality
- Deep learning for graphics and simulation
- Collision detection
- Real-time computer vision
- Navigation in virtual environments
- Texture synthesis
- Real-time post-processing effects
- Interactive 3D modeling
- In-the-wild 3D reconstruction
- Level-of-detail approaches
- Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications
- Visibility computation
- Real-time surface shading
- Fast shadows, caustics and reflections
- Impostors and image-based techniques
- Motion synthesis and path planning
- Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques
- Interaction devices and techniques
- User studies of interactive techniques
- Sketch-based 3D modeling and design
- Video game techniques
- Content generation techniques for real-time applications
- Novel techniques for game/interactive application design and development


# Submission Information

**Poster submissions should be in the form of a 2-page extended abstract using the ACM conference format with the ["sigconf"](https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors) style**. Alternatively, submissions may be in the form of (24x36 inches) posters, but extended abstracts are preferred. Please upload submissions for review at <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2025>. They will be reviewed in a single-blind process. Accepted poster authors are expected to: (1) provide a brief teaser video (30 seconds); (2) participate in an in-person fast-forward session at the conference; and, (3) bring a physical copy of the poster to the conference. The final posters could (and are expected to) be prepared after notification of acceptance, and should be 24x36 inches / approximately A1 in size. The conference will also include a poster session, with a Q&A opportunity for the poster authors. 

**This year's extended abstracts will appear in the I3D companion proceedings and in the ACM Digital Library.** Authors may choose to opt out of archiving, in which case their extended abstracts will not be published in either location. Note that submissions for work that was previously published in a different venue will not be published in either location as well. 

The extended abstracts of posters in the companion proceedings are considered **semi-archival; authors may re-use and re-submit the content to other peer-reviewed venues in the future.**


## Awards

There will be an award for the best poster submitted. Information about the prize will be announced at a later time.
