# Google Slides Template

To use the slides, [make a copy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wg4V4jaXuHR6Ue0mAK9z21es2OiYH0pS-RWAb-pxngo/copy) to your own drive

You can also download as [PPTX](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wg4V4jaXuHR6Ue0mAK9z21es2OiYH0pS-RWAb-pxngo/export/pptx) or [ODP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wg4V4jaXuHR6Ue0mAK9z21es2OiYH0pS-RWAb-pxngo/export/odp).

They use the font Outfit, you might need to get it and install it if you download them, from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) or from [github](https://github.com/Outfitio/Outfit-Fonts) (it is recommended to use the variable weight font).


# Logos and Banners

You can get a selection of logos and banners for I3D from our [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_bBLz6RELj5dwNLNSxQxEthmx_s-TFgR).

Again, for the SVG versions you will probably need the [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) font.
