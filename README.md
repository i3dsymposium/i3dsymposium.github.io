i3D 2016 Web Source
===================

The site uses the 960 Grid System (http://960.gs) for the layout,
modified into a fluid layout (960-fluid.css) with some additions
for responsive design (responsive.css).

Both the {header,footer}.html and css/i3d.css files are commented.

The individual html files should be self explanatory.

The system is built using Jekyll.
