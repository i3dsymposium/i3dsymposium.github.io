- Fix date format: either 5th of January 2024, or 5 January 2024

- Redesign default.html

- Update readme with logo/banner/icon generation and remove the logo.txt


- Add a media kit page, with logos and so on, maybe a powerpoint presentation template, so people can use it in their presentations if they want?
