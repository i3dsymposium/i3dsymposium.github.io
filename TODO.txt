TODO:

- Ensure favicon and metadata for social media work with new logo

- Redesign default.html

- Update readme with logo/banner/icon generation and remove the logo.txt


- Add a media kit page, with logos and so on, maybe a powerpoint presentation template, so people can use it in their presentations if they want?
