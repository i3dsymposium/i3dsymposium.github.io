TODO:

- Ensure favicon and metadata for social media work with new logo

- Redesign default.html

- Fix css `background-image: url(../img/logo.png);` in 2014, 2015, 2016
	and `../img/logo<year>.png;` in 2017 to 2022 to have the right logo for then



- Add a media kit page, with logos and so on, maybe a powerpoint presentation template, so people can use it in their presentations if they want?
