To encourage even more submissions we have decided to extend the deadline by one week.

Please help spread the word to your colleagues and collaborators.

We've additionally moved the poster notification deadline ahead to April 3, to enable accepted poster submitters to benefit from the Early Bird registration rates.


Submission deadline: 30 March 2023

Similar to previous years, there will be an award for the best student poster presentation (TBD exact details, but historically it's a high-end GPU), so make sure to submit yours to be eligible! See last year's awards at <https://i3dsymposium.org/2022/awards.html>.

Up to 2 pages in <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">"sigconf" style</a>.
