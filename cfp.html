<p>
Tentative Conference Dates: February 26 - 28, 2016<br>
Tentative Location: Redmond, Washington</p>

<p>I3D is the leading conference for real time 3D computer graphics and human
interaction. 2016 marks the 30th year since the first conference. We invite you
to submit papers across the entire range of topics of interaction, interactive
3D graphics, and games. The fall deadline provides the perfect outlet for your
summer work.</p>

<!-- In addition, GDC will be held right after I3D in the Bay Area,
making it an excellent opportunity to attend both conferences.</p> -->

<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li>Interaction devices and techniques</li>
<li>3D game techniques</li>
<li>Virtual and augmented reality</li>
<li>Interactive modeling</li>
<li>Level-of-detail approaches</li>
<li>Pre-computed lighting</li>
<li>Visibility computation</li>
<li>Real-time surface shading</li>
<li>Fast shadows, caustics and reflections</li>
<li>Imposters and image-based techniques</li>
<li>Animated models</li>
<li>GPU techniques</li>
<li>Navigation methods</li>
<li>Interactive visualization</li>
<li>Virtual and augmented reality</li>
<li>User studies of interactive techniques and applications</li>
<li>Sketch-based 3D interaction</li>
</ol></p>

The list of papers accepted (last year) to I3D 2015 can be found at <a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/csee/research/vangogh/I3D2015/papers.php">this link</a>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvVx5BNARY">Here</a> is a montage of some of those papers:

<p>Most paper submissions should be under 8 pages in length, though longer papers containing more extensive evaluation or system details are welcome.
Reviewers typically have higher expectations for conciseness, thorough evaluation, and the magnitude of contributions when reading longer papers.
Submissions should adhere to the <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/instructions-authors#smconf">ACM SIGGRAPH style guidelines</a>.
The submission of a video to accompany the paper is encouraged. Papers will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind process and authors notified by e-mail.

<p>The best I3D papers (about 4 to 6 papers) from 2016 will be
invited to submit extended versions to appear in a IEEE Transactions on
Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) special edition on I3D 2016.
Also, several of the most practical or implementation-minded papers will
be invited to submit extended versions to the Journal of Computer Graphics
Techniques (JCGT)</p>
