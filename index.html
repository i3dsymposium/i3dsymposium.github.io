<p class="lead" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">I3D is the leading conference for real time 3D computer graphics and human interaction.</p><br>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><b>New!</b></font> To clarify: all conference activities (including registration and meals) will be on the DigiPen campus.  For those staying at the Hyatt House, they also offer complementary breakfast.  (So you can eat twice!)
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><b>New!</b></font> Full details on Hao Chen's <a href="keynotes.html">Saturday keynote</a> are available.
</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00"><b>New!</b></font> We will have some shuttles to/from DigiPen from the Hyatt House, though ACM is being slow to get these fully confirmed.  Shuttles will be limited (a couple runs in the morning and a couple in the evening), so if you need to leave the conference early on Sunday to get a flight, we suggest you plan transport from DigiPen.  We encourage you to check with the hotel front desk when you arrive to find more details on shuttle schedules, and perhaps to book a spot on a particular run.
It is also a fairly easy 20-30 minute walk (<a href="img/walkingToDigiPen.png">see our 'high-tech' walking map</a>).
