<h4>Bio</h4> 
<p align="justify">For nearly two decades, Hao Chen has led graphics R&D and game engine development 
at a number of game companies, including SingleTrac, Microsoft, and Bungie. Hao 
helped shape the core technology for some of the most innovative and influential 
games in history, including the Halo series and Destiny. With each game they shipped, 
Hao and his teammates have consistently raised the visual bar for real time graphics
and much of their success is attributed to paring daring graphics research with 
solid engineering, while paying close attention to artist pipeline and workflow. 
Hao has a long history of collaborating with graphics researchers and such 
collaboration has led to wide adoption of a number of techniques in games. Hao is 
a frequent contributor to graphics and game conferences. Hao recently joined Amazon's 
games technology group as a senior principal engineer. In his spare time, Hao enjoys 
photography, making music and films, and piloting airplanes.
