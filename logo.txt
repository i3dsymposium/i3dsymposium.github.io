For the logo, there is an img/logo.xcf file which is the layered
logo in the GIMP file format. The text is on two separate editable
layers. For the drop shadow:

 - Delete or hide the previous year's text [and drop-shadow layers, if there is one].
 - Duplicate the "year editable text" layer. (Only that one. Don't duplicate the "year text drop shadow" layer.)
 - Rename the new layer as appropriate.
 - With the new layer selected, update the text to the current year.
 - From the Filters menu, select Light and Shadow >> Drop Shadow...
 - In the Drop Shadow dialog, [THIS HAS CHANGED 2021]
      Set Offset X and Offset Y to 4 and Blur Radius to 5
      Set Opacity to 70%. (0.700)
      Hit "OK".
	  

Export to "logoYYYY.png", e.g. logo2018.png.
	  
================================	  
PREVIOUS METHOD (2016? and before)
  - Duplicate the text layer
  - Offset the layer by 5px in the x and 4px in the y
  - Fill the text with rgb(51, 51, 51) using the bucket
  - Apply a gaussian blur filter with a 10px radius
  - Set the layer opacity to 70%
  - The layer boundary size may need to be adjusted to not clip
