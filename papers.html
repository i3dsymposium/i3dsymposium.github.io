<h3>Papers Program</h3>

<p>
Over the past two decades, the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) has selectively showcased 
exceptional progress in academic and industrial research in the field of computer graphics.

<br>
This year's symposium will be held at the <a href="http://www.intercontinentalmarkhopkins.com/">Intercontinental Mark Hopkins</a>hotel in San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
<!--
This year, 20 papers amongst 48 submissions were selected via a rigorous peer review process by a papers committee comprising 49 experts from academia and industry.
Accepted papers spanned a broad gamut of topics in computer graphics including interaction, geometry processing, simulation, animation, illumination and rendering.
Furthermore, 
-->
This year, we continue our collaboration with IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. 
    A selection of I3D papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of TVCG. 
    We are also continuing our partnership with the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques. 
    Some papers originally published in JCGT will be presented in the I3D plenary session, 
    and a selection of I3D papers will also be invited to submit extended versions for publication in JCGT.
    We hope these partnerships will continue bringing additional attention to I3D and the quality of the work published here.
</p>
<p>
The list of accepted papers will be available after the review period is over.
</p>
<p>	
Best paper presentation awards will be voted by attendees at the end of the symposium.
