          <p class="lead">I3D is the leading conference for real time 3D
          computer graphics and human interaction.</p>

          <p>2015 marks the 29th year since the first conference. This time we
          will be returning to San Francisco, California during February 27th to
          March 1st, 2015. We invite you to submit papers across the entire
          range of topics in interaction, interactive 3D graphics, and
          games.</p>

          <p>Like last year, I3D 2015 will be held immediately before the
          <a href="http://gdconf.com">Game Developers Conference (GDC'15)</a>
          in the Bay Area. This is an excellent opportunity to attend both
          conferences and see both research and application in real time 3D
          computer graphics.</p>
