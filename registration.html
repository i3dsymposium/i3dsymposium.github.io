<p>Meals will be <u>included</u> in all registration fees (except the free DigiPen category).

<p>**<b>DigiPen Registrations:</b> Thanks to the hosting freely provided by DigiPen, we were able to significantly reduce costs for other attendees.  In exchange, we would like to invite DigiPen students, faculty, and staff to attend technical sessions, keynotes, and posters for free (up to room capacity limits).  To guarantee a spot in the room, you may register at the link above, using a DigiPen-specific code.  Since we pay per-person catering costs, DigiPen attendees wishing to join us for meals (and get a copy of technical documentation) can register at our marginal cost of $150 using the same DigiPen registration code. Please register with a DigiPen e-mail and/or provide a local mailing address.
