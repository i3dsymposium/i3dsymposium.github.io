<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>The nearest airport is 
    <a href="http://bwiairport.com">Baltimore-Washington Int'l Airport</a> (BWI), 
    which has good domestic and international connections. Other area airports
    are <a href="http://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport">Reagan National Airport</a> (DCA)
    and <a href="http://flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport">Dulles Int'l Airport</a> (IAD). 
    However, Reagan and Dulles are significantly farther away from the conference venue.
</p>

<p><b>Make sure to plan your transport from the airport in advance!</b>  
    <!-- UMBC shuttle? -->
We encourage you to explore shared rides like 
    <a href="http://www.theairportshuttle.com/bwi">GO The Airport Shuttle</a> or
    <a href="https://reservations.supershuttle.com/">SuperShuttle</a>. 
<!--    Car sharing services like <a href="https://uber.com">Uber</a> normally run around $40. -->

Public transit is available to the <a href="">Redmond Transit Center</a>, which is within a short walk of Hyatt House.  According to the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org">Sound Transit</a> trip planner, the best route is to take the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/Rider-Guide/Link-light-rail">light rail link</a> from the airport to Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle, walk a block (to 4th Avenue and James St) to catch the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/ST-Express-Bus/545/">545 bus</a> to Redmond.   <a href="http://www.seattleairportbus.com/">This site</a> appears to have good overview of other public transit options.</p>

According to <a href="http://www.kayak.com">Kayak</a>, rental cars for the weekend run around $150, which may be the cheapest and most convenient approach for multiple attendees from the same institution (since parking at the Hyatt House and DigiPen is free).  Be aware that some roads in Seattle have tolls (in particular, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evergreen+Point+Bridge/@47.6035394,-122.223174,11.17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x549014ab906a26f3:0x9137ec6de317ce7f">520 bridge</a>), though taking the most direct route avoids tolls.  You may encounter heavy traffic from the airport to Redmond during rush hour on Friday (and rather arbitrarily on weekends).</p>
