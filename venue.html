This Hyatt House is the closest hotel to DigiPen, roughly 1.5 miles from DigiPen's campus.
<ul>
<li>This is an easy 5 minute drive, and both DigiPen and the Hyatt House offer free parking.
<li>The hotel provides free shuttles on weekdays, and we are discussing adding limited shuttle service on Saturday and Sunday.
<li>Loosely defined, this is walkable distance (via dedicated walking trails or streets) in ~30 minutes.
<li>On weekends, there is no public transit from the hotel to DigiPen.
<li>Uber is available in the area.
</ul>

<p>
The Hyatt House is located along the Sammamish River at the edge of "downtown" Redmond, which has a variety of restaurants, bars, shopping, and grocery stores.  It lies at the intersection of two recreation trails (the Redmond Connector and the Sammamish River Trail), both of which can be taken towards DigiPen.  

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>The nearest airport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport">Seattle-Tacoma Int'l Airport</a> (SEA), located around 25 miles southeast of Redmond, and has good domestic and international connections.</p>

<p><b>Make sure to plan your transport from the airport in advance!</b>  Standard cab rides to the Redmond area can easily reach $70.
We encourage you to explore shared rides like <a href="http://shuttleexpress.com/">Shuttle Express</a> of <a href="https://reservations.supershuttle.com/">SuperShuttle</a>, though you need to plan in advance to get good fares. Car sharing services like <a href="https://uber.com">Uber</a> normally run around $40.</p>

<p>
Public transit is available to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Redmond+Transit+Center/@47.6799379,-122.1301702,15.17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x549072b28d3601f1:0x83ab5d0f76c8c3d0">Redmond Transit Center</a>, which is within a short walk of Hyatt House.  According to the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org">Sound Transit</a> trip planner, the best route is to take the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/Rider-Guide/Link-light-rail">light rail link</a> from the airport to Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle, walk a block (to 4th Avenue and James St) to catch the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/ST-Express-Bus/545/">545 bus</a> to Redmond.   <a href="http://www.seattleairportbus.com/">This site</a> appears to have good overview of other public transit options.</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.kayak.com">Kayak</a>, rental cars for the weekend run around $150, which may be the cheapest and most convenient approach for multiple attendees from the same institution (since parking at the Hyatt House and DigiPen is free).  Be aware that some roads in Seattle have tolls (in particular, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evergreen+Point+Bridge/@47.6035394,-122.223174,11.17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x549014ab906a26f3:0x9137ec6de317ce7f">520 bridge</a>), though taking the most direct route avoids tolls.  You may encounter heavy traffic from the airport to Redmond during rush hour on Friday (and rather arbitrarily on weekends).</p>
