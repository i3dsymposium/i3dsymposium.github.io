<h3>Conference Venue</h3>

<p>DigiPen Institute of Technology has kindly agreed to host I3D on their campus in Redmond, WA from Friday, February 26 
through Sunday February 28, 2016.  DigiPen is located here:</p>

<p>
<a href="http://digipen.edu/">DigiPen Institute of Technology</a><br>
9931 Willows Road NE<br>
Redmond, WA 98052<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/DigiPen+Institute+of+Technology/@47.70054,-122.1391889,12.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54900d5c18a2fb13:0x2ea0971d7e01af72">Google Map</a></p>

<p>We have not yet finalized our recommended housing arragements (since I3D will not be in a hotel).  We are working with ACM to finalize a room block at a local hotel, and encourage you to wait until then to reserve rooms.  Due to its location in suburbia, DigiPen has limited housing choices nearby; we are working to get a hotel that provides at least limited shuttle service and is within a 30 minute walk of campus.</p>

<p>DigiPen and all local hotels have free parking.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>The nearest airport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport">Seattle-Tacoma Int'l Airport</a> (SEA), located around 25 miles southeast of Redmond, and has good domestic and international connections.</p>

<p><b>Make sure to plan your transport from the airport in advance!</b>  Standard cab rides to the Redmond area can easily reach $70.
We encourage you to explore shared rides like <a href="http://shuttleexpress.com/">Shuttle Express</a> of <a href="https://reservations.supershuttle.com/">SuperShuttle</a>, though you need to plan in advance to get good fares. Car sharing services like <a href="https://uber.com">Uber</a> normally run around $40.</p>

<p>
Public transit is available to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Redmond+Transit+Center/@47.6799379,-122.1301702,15.17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x549072b28d3601f1:0x83ab5d0f76c8c3d0">Redmond Transit Center</a>, which is within a short walk of the likely conference hotels, but could require a long ride.  <a href="http://www.seattleairportbus.com/">This site</a> appears to have good overview of public transit options.</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.kayak.com">Kayak</a>, rental cars for the weekend run around $150, which may be the cheapest and most convenient approach for multiple attendees from the same institution (since parking at Redmond hotels and DigiPen is free).  While direct routes from the airport will not have issues, be aware that some roads in Seattle have tolls (in particular, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evergreen+Point+Bridge/@47.6035394,-122.223174,11.17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x549014ab906a26f3:0x9137ec6de317ce7f">520 bridge</a>). You may encounter heavy traffic from the airport to Redmond until 10am on weekdays.</p>
